- 👋 Hi, I’m @APaintedWolf
- 👀 I’m interested in ... changing how we view the world, and one another.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Blender4 and UnrealEngine5 so that I may bring my passion projects to life. I want so badly to share my vision with others. Also checking out a Programming course but I'm bad at sticking with those, we'll see though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... learning, as I don't have much to offer as of yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... can you send messages here? Likely if you're wanting to reach me, you know how already... if I have a game or program, app or whatever out there, it's certainly got my contact info with it.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... she her they them
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Dungeons & Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin (Minotaur) must be one of my most favorite games ever, because I still carry around the Intellivision just for that game. I haven't tried it in about 15 years though, so it may no longer work. The Schrödinger's Cartridge. I'll tell you though... lately I've been wanting pretty hard to try getting it going.
